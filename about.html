                        <p><i>During my time at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP)
                            from 2014 to 2017, I started with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture. But because the
                            materials were too expensive, I switched to a more practical course,
                            Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). This is where I found my
                            interest in web development. Sadly, I had to stop my studies during the last semester of
                            my second year because I couldn't afford it anymore, especially after losing my scholarship.</i>
